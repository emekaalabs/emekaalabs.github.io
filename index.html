<p>SNX: The Top Shoe Drops This Week, And How To Get Your Hands On New Yeezys
Let’s face it, last week’s drops were lackluster. We even had to temporarily re-focus SNX because of it. But we’re putting that way behind us, because hype in the sneaker world is already heating up again with several worthwhile releases this week. But first, some bad news (immediately followed by good news) if you’re a Yeezy fan. The long-anticipated new Yeezy 350 v2 Clay, that was set to drop this week, was postponed yesterday and is now scheduled to hit stores at the end of the month. Which would be a shame if two additional colorways of the 350 v2s didn’t exist. This might come as news to some, as they’re releasing exclusively in overseas markets.</p>

<p>The Yeezy 350 v2 Trueform and the Hyperspace are still set to drop on the original March 16th date, and both colorways are actually significantly better than the Clays that are being sold to the American market. Which — what gives, Ye? Want to snag them? We’ll tell you how to get ahold of the exclusive colorways so you won’t have to miss out.</p>

<p>Here are the five best sneakers dropping in this week.
</p>
<p>Jordan Apex-Utility
</p>
<p>NIKE
</>
<p>It was only a matter of time before the design touchstones of the Nike React Element 87 made their way to other Nike silhouettes, but we never imagined they’d be coming this soon to a pair of Jordans. The Jordan Apex-Utility makes use of the 87’s signature translucent upper, with a lightweight Air Jordan 1 Flyknit underneath, for an ultra-lightweight pair of kicks. They feature adjustable heel straps and bright red tongue and heel tabs, the Jordan Apex-Utility sports red-letter Jumpman branding, and a hidden swoosh along the Flyknit upper atop a React midsole.
</p>
<p>The Jordan Apex-Utility is available today and will retail for $200 at select Jordan Brand retailers and the Nike online store.
Does wearing patent leather shoes before lunch make me a bad person?
I’ve tried it a couple of times this year and I think I may have got away with it

<p>Rapha Classic shoe

</p>


<p>Rapha’s Classic road going shoe is a distinctive lace design with one velcro strap over the fore foot. According to Rapha, the lacing system distributes tensional forces over a larger area, eliminating pinch points that can often be felt with a dial closure system.

According to the brand the double-wall lacing system closes the one-peice upper more securely. This is made from a seamless, perforated micro-fibre that feels harder than competitor lace-up shoes such as the Giro Empires. It features a low cut around the ankle which the brand says should avoid rubbing.

The sole is a full length carbon plate that’s wrapped in a thermoplastic for extra protection and additional grip when walking off of the bike. The shoes weigh 314g a shoe in a size 43, which is quite heavy. The use of double materials is likely to add weight compared to other full carbon soled shoes.
</p>
 




According to Rapha, the shoes have been through tens of thousands of kilometres of testing, including on the feet of EF-Education racerssuch as Lachlan Morton.


On my first few test rides, I’ve found the Classic shoes to be impressively comfortable, especially around the toe area which is more roomy than the Giro Empire ACC models I’ve been riding recently, avoiding any type of rubbing or pinching. My pair of size 43 shoes have been spot on. So far, I’ve not found any hotspots from the laces on the top of my foot, either. A full review will follow soon.

The shoes are available from a size 36-48, including half sizes and will cost £180.

<p>Rapha Explore shoe

</p>

<p>The Rapha Explore shoe follows hot on the heels of Rapha’s recent push into the gravel and adventure riding markets, with the brand saying it has been purpose built to stand up to the most demanding terrain and conditions.

It features the same carbon sole as its road going sibling, albeit it has been cut 3cm from the heel and 2cm from the toe to allow the fore-foot to bend when walking off-road. The sole is set into a rugged tread designed to provide traction on any terrain.

Elsewhere the design is much the same as the Classic shoe, including the double-wall lacing system and the seamless one-piece microfiber upper.

Rapha says these shoes have been tested over 30,000km on bike-packing expeditions and ultra-endurance races everywhere from the Dolomites through to the Sahara.

The Rapha Explore shoes will be available in four colours: Black, Black Pearl, Dark Green and High Vis Pink. Sizes range from 36-48 including half sizes and will cost £220.
